searchEngine
============

Multi-Threaded search engine running on a Jetty Server using Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, XML

This is a project I completed in my CS212 Software Development class during the 2014 fall semester.

It is a search engine that searches through premade websites created for the purpose of this project.
The code utilizes Log4j2, a logging/debugging plugin, and the jar file can be foud here: http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/logging/log4j/2.1/apache-log4j-2.1-bin.tar.gz
Also, it uses the javax.servlet jar to get the base for servlets on the jetty server.  jar can be found here: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/orbit/javax.servlet/3.0.0.v201112011016/

Currently, I do not have a SQL database set up to run this off of but I hope to have one running shortly
